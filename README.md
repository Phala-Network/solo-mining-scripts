## Instructions

#### Before Getting Started

> * Check at [Intel¬© Ark](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark.html#@Processors) that your processor is [Intel¬© SGX](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-guard-extensions/overview.html) compatible.
> 
> * Have [Ubuntu 18.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/), [Ubuntu 20.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) or [Ubuntu 21.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/21.04/) installed. Compatible kernel versions may vary.

-   #### BIOS Settings

    -   Disable Secure Boot
    -   Boot Mode must be **UEFI**
    -   Intel¬© SGX Settings must be **Enabled** or **Software Controlled**

:point_down: More details about the hardware requirements: 

[![Phala Wiki](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37558304/145890328-35ee96db-2713-4f53-8d62-d90aad16ab8c.png)](https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/docs/khala-mining/1-0-hardware-requirements/)

<h1 align="center">

#### Manual Installation

- Download the Script

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y
sudo apt install wget unzip
cd ~
wget https://github.com/Phala-Network/solo-mining-scripts/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip
rm -r main.zip #cleaning up the installation
```

-   Run the **egx_enable** if your SGX setting in BIOS is **Software Controlled**

```bash
cd solo-mining-scripts-main/ #note this depends on your current directory
sudo chmod +x sgx_enable
sudo ./sgx_enable
```

It is now recommended to reboot you machine. 

```bash
sudo reboot
```

### Troubleshooting

The community is here to help!
Check for [existing posts](https://forum.phala.network/c/mai/42-category/42) on our forum if you are stuck. In rare circumstances, your issue may be new; feel free to post it then so that we can help. For us to be able to help you, please read the [investigating the issue](#investigating-the-issue) first, so you know how and where to get your logs from prior to posting.

### General

Most symptoms are solved by restarting your node. If you experience issues running your node, try stopping the node by:

```bash
sudo phala stop
```

And attempt a restart with 
```bash
sudo phala start
```

If you still have issues attempt to [update the script](#update-the-script).

##### Investigating the Issue

Get an overview of your miner's status first.

```bash
sudo phala status
```

In case your node is stuck, a typical scenario would look like the following:

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://phala.network/">
    <img alt="Phala Network" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37558304/147273109-d4d1d5e3-5098-43d1-99f5-2ba995ecd1b6.png" height="250">
  </a>
</p>
(image showing stuck node on the miner)

With the symptom in the scenario above, the right method to solve the issue would be restarting the `node` container only, with the commands mentioned [here](stop-docker-separately), and restarting the containers.

Now check the status of the node again.

<h1 align="center">
</h1>


If the local node block height is empty first, check if all required containers are running.

```bash
sudo docker ps
```

You should have three containers running as shown in this example:

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://phala.network/">
    <img alt="Phala Network" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37558304/145825263-50d69b7e-a7e1-45c9-9eca-cc2d7d3a6b69.png" height="100">
  </a>
</p>

(image showing the miner node's running docker containers) 

To get the most recent logs of each container, you may execute:

```bash
docker logs <container_ID/container_name> -n 100 -f
```
Note that `<container_ID/container_name>` must be replaced with the container you wish the receive the logs from. In the example above the `container_ID` is `8dc34f63861e` and `container_name` would be `phala-pherry`.
\
If you attempt to post on the phala forum and do not know where the issue lies, please post [the logs](#get-logs) of all three docker containers. Copy-paste the container logs from the terminal into the forum post. 

If a container is missing, you may attempt to restart it separately with the respective commands below.
Use the applicable command for your missing container:

```bash
sudo phala start node
```

```bash
sudo phala start pruntime
```

```bash
sudo phala start pherry
```

##### Peer Connectivity

Some users running nodes may find their nodes are struggling to connect to peers, which causes nodes to be dropped from the network.
You can check your node connections through executing:

```bash
sudo docker logs -f phala-node
```

For an optimal setup, you should have between 40 and 50 peers.

If you have insufficient peers do the following:
* Check your firewall settings
* Ensure there are no NAT or Policy-based filters

Feel free to read [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) for more information if you are curious about the root causes. Also, do not hesitate to look for existing [Phala forum posts](https://forum.phala.network/c/mai/42-category/42) before posing your issue if you are stuck. 

<h1 align="center">

##### Failed to install the DCAP driver

:information_source: The most common issue is that your mainboard may not support a DCAP driver. In this case, the script cannot automatically install the `isgx` driver and results in the following error message.

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://phala.network/">
    <img alt="Phala Network" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37558304/143471619-1116c12f-7ef5-4313-93a5-51f3ed30c355.png" height="250">
  </a>
</p>

(image of the terminal showing the DCAP driver error message) 


In this case, prior to running `sudo phala start`, you need to manually install the `isgx` driver:

```bash
sudo phala install isgx
```

<h1 align="center">
</h1>

##### Khala Node Stops Synching

If the Khala Chain stops synching and is stuck at a specific block and does not continue to sync, we advise you first to [restart your node](#troubleshooting).
Prior to restarting your miner confirm that your node is stuck, through execututing:

```bash
docker logs phala-node -n 100 -f
```

Within the logs if there is an issue in synchronizing a block, it will typically look as follows:

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://phala.network/">
    <img alt="Phala Network" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37558304/146648049-4f1a098f-63ef-4263-9b18-8020d686bd8a.png" height="100">
  </a>
</p>

If the synchronization still fails, you may try to delete the khala chain database on your miner's node.  
It is located in `/var/khala-dev-node/chains/khala`.

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://phala.network/">
    <img alt="Phala Network" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37558304/143770078-26a3c457-ce1d-447c-8e26-81ea0e1beb9b.png" height="100">
  </a>
</p>

(image showing the khala blockchain files of the miner node) 

It is located in `/var/khala-dev-node/chains/khala`.

First, stop your node with:

```bash
sudo phala stop
```

To delete the khala blockchain database on your node, execute the following commands:

```bash
rm -rf /var/khala-dev-node/chains/khala
```

To delete the Kusama blockchain , run:

```bash
rm -rf /var/khala-dev-node/polkadot
```

Now [restart your node](#troubleshooting).
